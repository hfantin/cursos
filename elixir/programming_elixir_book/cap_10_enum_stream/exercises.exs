  # (Hard) Write a flatten(list) function that takes a list that may contain any
  # number of sublists, which themselves may contain sublists, to any depth.
  # It returns the elements of these lists as a flat list.
  # iex> MyList.flatten([ 1, [ 2, 3, [4] ], 5, [[[6]]]])
  # [1,2,3,4,5,6]
  # The simplest version is probably to use list concatenation. However,
  # this version ends up rebuilding the list at each step

  # JosÃ© Valim came up with a different implementation. It is interesting
  # to spend some time with this, because it breaks down the problem
  # a little differently. Rather that extract individual elements
  # to built the result list, it treats the original list more like
  # a tree, flattening subtrees on the right and merging the results
  # into a tree that itself gets flattened.
